# PhishNet
• Employed TF-IDF vectorization and NLTK for tokenization to train RandomForest and XGBClassifier models on
over 44,000 data points of phishing emails and URLs, achieving a 99.4% accuracy rate on test data.

• Architected Flask-based REST API with React.js front-end to facilitate real-time phishing detection, displaying
predictions and confidence levels based on user-submitted email or URL inputs, and used MongoDB to store data and display statistics.
